## Problem Statement
    A farmer wants to farm their land with the maximum area where good land is present.
    The "land" is represented as a matrix with `1`s and `0`s, where `1` means good land and `0` means bad land. 
    The farmer only wants to farm in a square of good land with the maximum area. 
    Please help the farmer to find the maximum area of the land they can farm in good land.

### Example:

<pre>
0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0
</pre>

### Input:
- A binary matrix representing the land, where `1` indicates good land and `0` indicates bad land.

### Output:
- The maximum area of the square containing good land (i.e., the maximum dimension of a square composed entirely of `1`s).

### Constraints:
- The matrix can have varying dimensions (rows and columns).
- You may assume that the matrix contains only `0`s and `1`s.
