### Explanation

- **BFS Function**: The `bfs_shortest_path` function finds the shortest path from a start node to a finish node using breadth-first search.
- **Graph Representation**: The graphs for both problems are represented as dictionaries, where keys are nodes and values are lists of adjacent nodes.
- **Output**: The program prints the shortest paths for both problems.
